# 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal

> My original post: [A easy understandable recursive solution for tree problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal/discuss/276633/a-easy-understandable-recursive-solution-for-tree-problem)

### A simple recursive DFS pattern for tree problem is:

1. DFS to the left side of node.
2. DFS to the right side of node.
3. Based on given conditions, organize the way of calling 1 and 2.

For this problem, the key point is to understand in which condition to add left children or right children for each node.

Think in a greedy way, for each node, always try to add left child and right child, except two conditions:

* If current node depth (level) is larger than expected depth, it means current node is next new level of its parent, so, it will always be left children.
* If current node depth is less than expected depth it means current node is not current node's children, or even higher ancestor. so it will return nullptr. To force the DFS travesal back to previosly DFS call with lower expected depth.

Two conditions above will tell whether a node's left or right children is exist. Thus, the current node depth and expected depth are key parameters to recover the tree.

Another importance note is: 
* for each node, DFS try to find next level node as deeper as possible unless next level node is nullptr, thus expected depth will increase by one at each DFS call:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* recoverFromPreorder(string S) {
        int index = 0;
        return dfs(S, index, 0);
    }
    
    TreeNode* dfs(string& S, int& index, int level) {
        if (index >= S.length()) return nullptr;
        // get the level for this node
        int curLevel = 0;
        while (S[index] == '-') {
            index++;
            curLevel++;
        }
        if (curLevel < level) {
            index -= curLevel;
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        // get the number for this node
        int num = S[index++] - '0';
        while (S[index]-'0' >= 0 && S[index]-'9' <= 0) {
            num = 10 * num + (S[index++] - '0');
        }
        
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(num);
        
        if (curLevel == level) {
            node->left = dfs(S, index, level+1);
            node->right = dfs(S, index, level+1);
        } else if (curLevel > level) {
            node->left = dfs(S, index, curLevel+1);
        }
        
        return node;
    }
};
```

Note:

1. To support recursive solution, string index should pass as a reference.
2. If condtion 2 happens, string index will recover to its original value before current function call.
3. Above case introduce performance burden (current 24ms comparing to the best), it could be fine-tuned by add next level in each recursive call to avoid index travesal back.
