# 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

> My original post: [A typical recursive C++ solution for tree problem, beats 99.72% in time and 100% in memory](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/discuss/276203/a-typical-recursive-c-solution-for-tree-problem-beats-9972-in-time-and-100-in-memory)

The answer is **the maximum node of subtree - minimum node of subtree**.

1. User **DFS** to travesal the tree structure, since DFS ensure visit each node only once.
2. Update the maximum node of subtree and minimum node of subtree.
3. Update the maximum difference ( the *diff* of current subtree, the *diff* of current node's left subtree and right subtree) for each node.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, 100000, 0);
    }
    
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int curMin, int curMax) {
        if (node == nullptr) return 0;
        if (node->val < curMin) curMin = node->val;
        if (node->val > curMax) curMax = node->val;
        int left = dfs(node->left, curMin, curMax);
        int right = dfs(node->right, curMin, curMax);
        return max(curMax - curMin, max(left, right));
    }
};
```
