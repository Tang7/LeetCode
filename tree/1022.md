# 1022. [Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers/)

The sum could get from iterating the tree structure, therefore there is no need to use DFS.

The key numeric logic from such tree struct are:
1. Whenever reach a non-nullptr node, the ```sum from root to current node``` = ```sum from root to its parent node * 2``` if current ```node->val == 0```. Similar as left move the entire bits 1 bit, from 11 to 110.
2. If current ```node->val == 1```, from 11 to 111, equals to 110 + 1 which is 110 | 001 in binary operation.

Above two cases could combines as ``` num = num << 2 | node->val```.

Since the parent node sum is the main return value, and is the key value to calculate next recursive step, the recursive function have to include parent node sum as a parameter in it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        return sumTree(root, 0);
    }
    
    int sumTree(TreeNode* node, int num) {
        if (node == nullptr) return 0;
        num = num << 1 | node->val;
        if (!node->left && !node->right) return num;
        return sumTree(node->left, num) + sumTree(node->right, num);
    }
};
```
