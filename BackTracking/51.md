# 51. [N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

At first I used graph algorithm to solve this issue. Treat the chessboard as a grid, and try to put Queen in each slot in a row, and then check validation to proceed with next row.

The best I could get for DFS solution is:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        vector<vector<string>> queens;
        // i-th row, pos[i]-th col has a queen;
        vector<int> pos(n, -1);
        vector<string> state(n, string(n, '.'));
        dfs(queens, state, pos, 0, n);
        return queens;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<string>>& queens, vector<string>& state, vector<int>& pos, int row, const int n) {
        if (row == n) {
            queens.push_back(state);
            return;
        }
        for (int col = 0; col < n; ++col) {
            if (valid(pos, row, col)) {
                pos[row] = col;
                state[row][col] = 'Q';
                dfs(queens, state, pos, row+1, n);
                pos[row] = -1;
                state[row][col] = '.';
            }
        }
        return;
    }
    
    bool valid(const vector<int>& pos, const int row, const int col) {
        for (int x = 0; x < row; ++x) {
            if (pos[x] == col) return false;
            if (row-x == abs(col-pos[x])) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

To validate the Queens position, an extra for-loop is used in ```valid```

The problem has the same property as [Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/). Which is the previous choice will be excluded in next step when searhcing the answer.
