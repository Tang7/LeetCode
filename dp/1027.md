# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence

> My original post: [A typical DP solution for loop search problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence/discuss/276237/a-typical-dp-solution-for-loop-search-problem)

The basic thought is:

1. For each num at index *i* (*i >= 1*), calculate the different between previous index *j (j < i): A[i] - A[j]*.
2. For each previous index *j*, two key variables are needed to compute longest arithmetic sequence: the arithmetic sequence with difference *A[j] - A[x] (x < j)*, and its length. Using *DP[j][diff]* to represent the length of arithmetic sequence which step difference is diff and ends at j th index.
3. *If A[i] - A[j] == A[j] - A[x], DP[i][A[i]-A[j]] = DP[j][A[j]-A[x]] + 1*.

Considering the time complexity. There are n numbers in the vector. For each number, step 1 cost *O(n)*. If using vector in step 2, it will also cost *O(n)* to search the same difference as *A[i] - A[j]*. Thus the overall time complexity will be *O(n^3)*.

However, considering the difference (step) for each index is unique, using unordered map will decrease step 2 time complexity from *O(n)* to *O(1)*.

Thus the problem could easily solved:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size(), ret = 2;
        vector<unordered_map<int, int>> dp(n, unordered_map<int, int>());
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int curNum = A[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                int diff = curNum - A[j];
                if (dp[j].find(diff) == dp[i].end()) {
                    dp[i][diff] = 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][diff] = dp[j][diff] + 1;
                    ret = max(ret, dp[i][diff]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
